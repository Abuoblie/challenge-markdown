## Pat Summitt 
> _Winning is fun…. Sure. But winning is not the point. Wanting to win is the point. Not giving up is the point. Never letting up is the point. Never being satisfied with what you’ve done is the point._ 
###### Confidence and persistence, it's my belief that the capability of a man is limitless, hence you can attain any height if you work towards it.

## A funny story 
   I had an appointment at a lab for a project that I have accepted to partake in.  on a day that I thought was a day before the d day. I was at home sleeping when I received a call that the project is about to start in 20 minute  so I had to get up and hurried to the place. 
#### TL;DR
i had an appoitment but did not relised the day was due.
